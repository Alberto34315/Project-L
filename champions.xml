<nombre>Aatrox</nombre>
<descripcion>Aatrox and his brothers, once respected defenders of Shurima against the Void, would end up becoming an even 
greater threat to Runeterra and knew only defeat from the cunning use of deadly spells. 
However, after centuries of seclusion, Aatrox was the first to regain his freedom and dedicated himself to corrupting and 
transforming any fool who tried to wield the magic weapon that contained its essence.</descripcion>
<p>Aatrox's next basic attack gains 50 bonus range 
and deals 5-12% of the target's maximum health 
as bonus physical damage (based on level),
 while healing Aatrox for 100% of the bonus physical
 damage dealt (reduced to 25% against minions). 
 This damage is capped at 100 against monsters.</p>
<q>Aatrox swings his greatsword in the target direction, 
striking enemies in a line.
 The Darkin Blade can then be 
 reactivated twice within 4 seconds,
 with the second cast refreshing the timer.
 The second cast strikes enemies in a cone and 
 the third in the target area. 
 The first cast deals 10 / 30 / 50 / 70 / 90 
 (+0.6 / 0.65 / 0.7 / 0.75 / 0.8 per attack damage) physical damage,
 increasing by 25% on the second cast and 50% on the third.
 The Darkin Blade deals 55% damage to minions.</q>
<w>Aatrox smashes the ground in the target direction, 
creating a chain that stops on the first enemy hit, 
dealing 30 / 40 / 50 / 60 / 70 (+0.4 per attack damage) 
physical damage (doubled against minions) 
and slowing them by 25% for 1.5 seconds.
 If Infernal Chains hits a champion or large monster, 
 they are chained to the impact area. 
 If the chained enemy is still in the impact area after 1.5 seconds,
 they are dragged to the center and take the same damage again.</w>
<e>Passive: Aatrox heals for 20 / 22.5 / 25 / 27.5 / 30% 
of the non-periodic damage he deals to champions.
Active: Aatrox dashes in the target direction.
Umbral Dash can be cast during his other 
spellcasts without interrupting them.</e>
<r>After 0.25 seconds, Aatrox reveals his true demonic form for 10 seconds. 
On activation, he fears nearby enemy minions for 3 seconds 
and gains 60 / 80 / 100% bonus movement speed,
 decaying over the duration.
While World Ender persists, Aatrox gains 20 / 25 / 30% bonus attack damage 
and receives 50 / 60 / 70% increased self-healing.
On enemy champion takedown, 
the duration of World Ender is extended by 5 seconds 
and the movement speed increase is refreshed.</r>
